# Python-Movie-Industry-Correlation-Project
finding correlations in the dataset using Python

Project Overview

This project explores a dataset from the movie industry and focuses on understanding relationships between key numerical features using correlation analysis. The goal is to identify which variables are most strongly related and to practice end-to-end data analysis skills.

Steps Performed

Importing Libraries
Essential Python libraries for data analysis and visualization were imported:

pandas – for data manipulation

numpy – for numerical operations

matplotlib & seaborn – for visualization

Reading the Dataset
The movie industry dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.

Checking Missing Data
Inspected the dataset for missing values and calculated percentages of nulls per column.

Data Cleaning

Handled missing data where necessary

Converted columns to appropriate data types

Standardized column names

Correlation Analysis

Calculated correlation coefficients between numerical features

Visualized correlations using a heatmap for better interpretability

Findings

Identified the strongest correlations in the dataset

Highlighted interesting relationships between features such as budget, gross, and other numerical variables

Tools & Technologies

Python 3.x

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Key Takeaways

Hands-on practice of data cleaning and preprocessing

Understanding correlation and its significance in exploratory data analysis

Experience in presenting analytical findings visually with heatmaps and scatterplots
