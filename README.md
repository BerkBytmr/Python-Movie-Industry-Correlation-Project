Movie Industry Data Analysis – Correlation Insights
Overview

A Python project analyzing a movie industry dataset to explore relationships between key numerical features. The project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis, from cleaning to visualization.

Steps

Import Libraries – pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

Load Dataset – read the movie industry dataset into a DataFrame

Check Missing Data – inspect nulls and percentages

Data Cleaning – handle missing values and correct data types

Correlation Analysis – calculate correlations and visualize using a heatmap

Findings – identify strong relationships (e.g., budget vs gross)

Tools

Python 3.x

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

How to Run
git clone <your-repo-link>
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code and run all cells.

Outcome

Cleaned and explored the dataset

Visualized correlations clearly

Identified key relationships between numerical features
